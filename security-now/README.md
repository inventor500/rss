# Security Now

[Security Now](https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm) (from [twit.tv](https://twit.tv)) is an excellent cyber security podcast. Unfortunately, the podcast download links go through a lot of redirects before going to the final download link. These redirect domains may track or block the unwary feed surfer. This script eliminates some of the redirects by pointing podcast URLs directly to <https://traffic.libsyn.com>.
