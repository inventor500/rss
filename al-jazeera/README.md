# Al Jazeera

Al Jazeera is a state-sponsored news organization in Qatar.

Unfortunately the `<managingEditor>` field is set to "apps.support@aljazeera.net (Apps Support),"
which causes NewsBoat to assume that that is the name of every article author. This script replaces every instance of
that email with "Al Jazeera."
